I'm currently building this interesting website using Django.

A comprehensive README will be available soon to guide you through all the functionalities. Stay tuned for the launch!

As of now you may download the whole project or just the somewhat finished guide that I was writing as website development progressed. The guide is in no way finished and needs more work and same goes for the website. Im trying for daily updates and project should be finished and live on the web soon.
